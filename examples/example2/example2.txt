$text Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
$text And sorry I could not travel both
$text And be one traveller, long I stood
$text And looked down one as far as I could
$text To where it bent in the undergrowth;

$text Then took the other, just as fair,
$text And perhaps having the better claim,
$text Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
$text Though as for that the passing there
$text Had worn them really about the same,

$text And both that morning equally lay
$text In leaves, no steps had trodden black.
$text Oh, I kept the first for another day!
$text Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
$text I doubted if I should ever come back.

$text Somewhere ages and ages hence;

$text I took the one less traveled by,
$text And that has made all the difference.
